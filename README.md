# RaD_Score_Calculator
a AC6 score calculator for our DC group use.

## 先請你花個不到一分鐘來看下面的事項須知再去網站吧  

要查看各個部件的分數和id去 src/data_folder/units_data.js 裡面看，  
我都分類好了，你要看的只有 name 和 score ， id在大多情況都可以直接忽略。  

如果發現有部件不符合的話要報錯，請按 F12 開啟 Console，然後選好有問題的零件後按下 "Calculate Score" 的按鈕  
沒意外的話，會出現你選取的各種零件，把這張圖擷取下來跟我講。

## Please take less than a minute to read the following notes before visiting the website
To check the scores and IDs of each part, go to src/data_folder/units_data.js.
I've already sorted them into categories. The only things you need to look at are the name and score; the id can usually be ignored.

If you find a part that doesn’t match or seems incorrect, please report it.
Press F12 to open the Console, then select the problematic parts and click the "Calculate Score" button.
If everything works correctly, it should show all the parts you've selected. Take a screenshot of that and let me know.

裡面的檔案有一半是我東參考西參考拼出來的，所以要做好遇到非常奇怪BUG的心理準備

About half of the files were pieced together from various references, so be mentally prepared to encounter some really weird bugs.
